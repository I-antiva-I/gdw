C# ("C sharp") is a powerful, modern programming language developed by Microsoft Corporation.

Like Python, C# is a general-purpose programming language. It's widely used for building a variety of applications, including desktop software, web applications, mobile apps, cloud services, and enterprise software, and games.

C# is an object-oriented programming (OOP) language, which means it supports concepts like classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism. This allows for modular and reusable code, making it easier to manage large projects.

While initially developed for Windows, C# is now supported on multiple platforms through the cross-platform .NET Core and .NET 5 frameworks. This allows developers to build C# applications that can run on Windows, macOS, and Linux. The .NET Framework provides a rich set of libraries and tools for developing desktop, web, and server applications in C#.


C# also includes features like garbage collection and extensive standard libraries.
