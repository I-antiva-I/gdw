Algorithms are step-by-step commands or rules for solving a particular problem or accomplishing a specific task. In computing, algorithms are used to perform computations, process data, and automate tasks. They are the foundation of computer programs. Algorithms can be expressed in various forms: natural language, pseudocode, flowcharts, and programming languages.

A good algorithm should:
Provide clear and unambiguous instructions for solving a problem, in other words each step in the algorithm must be well-defined and executable.

Must have a finite number of steps - every algorithm should eventually terminate and produce some result.

Must be efficient. The most usual factors are time complexity (how long it takes to find result) and space complexity (how much memory is required).

Should produce the correct output for all valid inputs.
